				As I said before, I am a tireless seeker of wisdom.
				For as long as I can remember, I've been very interested in technology, specifically computers.
				here is just something about computers that makes me want to get involved with them and one of my goals is to find out what that "something" is. Although I was mainly interested in technology, 
				I recently found another thing that interested me and that was blogging.
				Initially, I was just interested in computers because they had the ability to play games, but as I grew older, I became curious as to how they work.
				<br>
				Here are the list I want to learn to further
				enhance my computer knowledge.
				
				<br>
				<br>
					<li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
					<li>Web Programming</li>
					<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
					<li>Database Programming</li>
					<li>Operating Systems Design</li>
					<li>Dat Structures</li>
					<li>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</li>
					<li>Data Communications and Networking</li>
					<li>Machine Level Programming</li>
